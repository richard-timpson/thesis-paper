\chapter{Discussion} \label{ch:ch6}
\rtodo[,inline]{The following are some interesting discussion ideas that have come up so far. There is no telling if these will be in the final paper or not after conducting more experiments.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transformer performs worse according the quantitative metrics. This could be because it doesn't build in a specific hierarchical layer that is specific the problem. It is a much more generic model. There is a lot of room for exploration into experimenting with different architectures based on the Transformer to better fit the problem domain. \rtodo[,inline]{Add more discussion based on more results}
    \item Transformer appears to be a more dynamic model than the recurrent virtuosoNet model that makes more "mistakes". Does this mean that it is more "human". \rtodo{Add discussion of uncanny valley}
    \item Pedal in performance is messy. Could be because of problems in the feature and modeling, or could just be because it is a difficult problem to model. 
    \item \rtodo[,inline]{Discussion on qualitative results}
