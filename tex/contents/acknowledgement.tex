I would first like to acknowledge Professor Srikumar for agreeing to take me as his student and advise me in my research. When I first approached him with the general idea of doing a research project involving Machine Learning and music, neither he nor I had the slightest bit of background in the research area. Although this project's scope has been relatively small, we have both learned an immense amount about music information retrieval and broadened our scope of understanding in applied Machine Learning, which had previously centered around NLP. I want to thank Vivek for his efforts in supporting me in my research interests even though he had limited domain knowledge. 

I would also like to thank my wife Vivian and my daughter Sonya for understanding and supporting me through some of the struggles that I encountered while working on this project. The last six months have been a chaotic time for both my family and me, and without their continued support, I would not have been able to complete the project on time. I look forward to giving them more of my attention and time now that it is complete.
